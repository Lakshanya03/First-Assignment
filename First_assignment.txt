1. WHAT ARE YOUR MOTIVATIONS TOWARDS BIOINFORMATICS?

I wanted to explore more about bioinformatics practically which is more helpful than learning it theoretically.
Bioinformatics has great impact in the other fields of life science like in the genetic research, in drug discovery and delivery,etc..
For the future development of biotechnology, bioinformatics will have a great role to play in it. So i think inorder to sustain in 
biotechnology field knowledge in bioinformatics is a must. I think it is more interesting to learn it practically rather than
theoretically.




2. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO GAIN FROM THIS ASSOCIATION?

I dont knw much about bioinformatics, maybe if itcomes to be theory i have a bit idea about it but practically i want to explore more.
I just want an idea about the codingand the other tools.
